### **Chicago, Miranda**

#### Color Scheme

- The red is very jarring and very high contrast, especially in comparison to the softer light blue you use as an accent elsewhere. Potentially change to a more readable cohesive color scheme by using more colors or changing the shade of the red.
  - Severity level: 4/5
- The dark blue is really nice and is very readable. Next to the Black that is also used in many places it is a bit strange because the colors are so similar and used similarly as accents throughout the site. Consistent choices for what colors are accents vs. main elements could be nice.
  - Severity level: 1/5

#### Layout and box mode

- The content is nicely centered in the middle, but is very narrow, especially the header and footer, which I would expect (in your design format here) to span across the entire viewport.
  - Severity level: 2/5
- The pictures on the home page are clickable but not the text. There is nothing indicating that the pictures might be clickable and I would default to trying to click the text, especially with the "..." in the text blurbs. You could anchor tag the text too or just anchor tag the entire box of content to make sure the user knows for sure that they can interact with the page.
  - Severity level: 2/5

#### Visual embellishments

- The background color of the text on the header and footer is nice, but should span the entire header and footer, it looks a bit strange the way it is. The actual "Chicago, Illinois" text has a lecel of transparency that makes it difficult to read. With the background color helping the contrast against the skyline picture, the text could be fully opaque and the skyline would still be visible.
  - Severity level: 2/5
- The map feature you have on the "Museums" site is really cool, but when I am logged into my UR google account I can't see it because of permimssions or something. I have no way of knowing what that is unless I log into another account. Is there a way you could indicate what the purpose of that feature is so the user can decide whether they want to invest the effort to see it properly? You might caption it or otherwise add context for what that feature is supposed to do.
  - Severity level: 3/5
- The sticky thing you did with the footer was really cool, but having the content slide over it was a bit strange, especially with the contrast between the sharp corners of the footer and the rounded corners of the content boxes.
  - Severity level: 2/5

#### Standout Features

- I really liked that you added "Visit" buttons on all the museums, it makes the website very practical and realistically useful. The links don't open a new tab though, which I would expect a link to an external site to do.
  - Severity level: 1/5
- I thought it was super fun that you had a "Gallery" page, but there's no captions or textual context on the page to tell me what I am looking at and why.
  - Severity level: 2/5

### **Ridgewood, Matthew**

#### Color Scheme

- The background color was a very nice and easy-on-the-eyes shade and paired really well with the grey color of the text.
- (IDK if this is a "color" thing technically) the paragraph font is a bit thin, using a heavier weight would be more readable.
  - Severity level: 2/5

#### Layout and box mode

- The navigation is at the bottom of the site and no other parts of the site are clickable to lead to the other pages. On smaller viewports where you have to scroll to see the navigation, it's not intuitively clear that the site is multi-paged.
  - Severity level: 3/5
- The pictures being 2 different sizes is a bit strange, perhaps sizing them the same or making the size idfference more intentional with more design elements would make the difference less distracting to the user
  - Severity level: 1/5
-The container for the paragraph text of the "Parks" page is narrower than the rest of the pages, which is strange. Consistency in width here between all the pages might be nicer.
  - Severity level: 2/5
- The content is all left justified except for the nav and footer, which would be fine, but the container is not visible so the centered text in contrast with the left-justified text makes it appear as if the right margin is uneven/larger
  - Severity level: 1/5
- The anchor tags that contain the pictures have padding on them, which moves the pictures in and away from the alignment on the left, whcih is slightly off and distracting. It also strangely makes the space around the picture clickable. You may want to get rid of this padding entirely or change it to margins and make the spacing more pronounced and intentional.
  - Severity level: 2/5

#### Visual embellishments

- You have 2 h1 level headings on your pages instead of utilizing h2s. Semantically, this doesn't make a ton of sense to me, but the lack of visual difference between the 2 headings is the main issue that makes it difficult for the user to instinctively know where they should point their attention to. I would advise changing your second h1s to h2s and styling them differently so the user isn't constantly re-reading the "Ridgewood, NJ" header everytime they navigate to a new page.
  - Severity level: 4/5
- The footer is much darker than the grey of the navigation and pulls the attention towards the footer rather than the main content or navigation right above the footer. Unless the footer content is higher priority for the user, you might want to make the footer a smaller font and/or lighter color.
  - Severity level: 2/5

#### Standout Features

- It's cool that you made the pictures clickable with the color change on hover. However, the fact that those are clickable and lead to the home page but the header is not clickable seems a bit strange. There's nothing that points the user to intuitively understand the pictures navigate to the home page. They also both link to the same page, which seems strange. If you captioned the pictures and had them lead to the "History" or "Geography" page (whichever makes more sense) that would make more sense. You might also consider making the header clickable to navigate to the home page.
  - Severity level: 3/5

### **Phoenix, Kyler**

#### Color Scheme

- The white background of the lower section of the home page and the content of the other pages could be more transparent, the picture behind it is not as visible as it could be.
  - Severity level: 2/5
- The black and white is a bit boring. Adding more accent colors might make it a bit nicer looking. Maybe a light pink-ish toned color would help match the background image and bring more excitement.
  - Severity level: 1/5

#### Layout and box mode

- The content on the weather, water, and cactus pages is not centered in larger viewports. The margins and/or width likely need to be changed.
  - Severity level: 5/5
- Weird horizontal scroll bars show up in smaller viewports. You can change the grid boxes to be flex instead so it is more responsive to the changing viewport size.
  - Severity level: 5/5
- The footer is not stuck to the bottom so there is a weird empty space under it in taller viewports. The footer could be made sticky or positioned at the bottom.
  - Severity level: 5/5
- The homepage shows no indication of there being more content at the bottom of the page. You could bring the heading of the next section up higher or make the large content not as tall.
  - Severity level: 3/5
- The figures have margins that push them out of alignment with the text side lines. You could get rid of these margins.
  - Severity level: 2/5

#### Visual Embellishments

- The paragraph font loads really slowly. Maybe there is another font you can use?
  - Severity level: 2/5

#### Standout Features

- The slide-y effect of the boxes at the bottom of the home page is cool, but if you hover in just the wrong place the text won't transition. Maybe there is a js plugin that would do this better than using CSS hover transitions.
  - Severity level: 3/5
